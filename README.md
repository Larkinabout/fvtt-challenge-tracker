# Challenge Tracker
An interactive aid to track successes and failures in challenges.

## How to Use
Create a macro with a Type of 'script' and enter: `ChallengeTracker.open(successes, failures)` where `successes` is the number of successes required and `failures` is the number of failures required. Execute the macro to open the Challenge Tracker.

Successes are tracked on the outer ring while failures are tracked on the inner circle. Left-click anywhere within the outer ring to add a success and anywhere within the inner circle to add a failure. Right-click within the ring or circcle to remove successes or failures, respectively.

Currently, only the GM can open, control and close the Challenge Tracker. In a future release, I'll add the functionality to hand over the Challenge Tracker to a player.
